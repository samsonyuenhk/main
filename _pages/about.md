I am a political scientist who is interested in contentious politics, conflict processes, public opinion and state-society relations, with a regional focus on China and East Asia. Currently, I am Associate Professor of Political Science at the Department of Government and International Studies of Hong Kong Baptist University. I am also the Director of the Comparative Governance and Policy Research Centre, Hong Kong Baptist University. I have been a visiting fellow in the Australia Centre on China in the World, Australian National University.

My research has been published in _Democratization_, _Geopolitics_, _Government and Opposition_, _Journal of Conflict Resolution_, _Journal of Peace Research_, _Journal of Contemporary China_, _Mobilization_, _Political Psychology_, _Political Studies_, _Social Movement Studies_, _The China Quarterly_, and others. My book, _The Making of Leaderful Mobilization: Power and Contention in Hong Kong_ (coauthored book with Edmund W. Cheng), is published by Cambridge University Press under the Cambridge Series in Contentious Politics.
